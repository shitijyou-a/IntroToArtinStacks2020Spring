  abstract = {This is a systematic study of the behaviour of finite coverings of (affine) schemes with regard to two Grothendieck topologies: the canonical topology and the fpqc topology. The history of the problem takes roots in the foundations of Grothendieck topologies, passes through main strides in Commutative Algebra and leads to new Mathematics up to perfectoids and prisms. We first review the canonical topology of affine schemes and show, keeping with Olivier's lost work, that it coincides with the effective descent topology; covering maps are given by universally injective ring maps, which we discuss in detail. We then give a "catalogue raisonn\textbackslash{}'e" of examples of finite coverings which separate the canonical, fpqc and fppf topologies. The key result is that finite coverings of regular schemes are coverings for the canonical topology, and even for the fpqc topology (but not necessarily for the fppf topology). We discuss a "weakly functorial" aspect of this result. "Splinters" are those affine Noetherian schemes for which every finite covering is a covering for the canonical topology. We also investigate their mysterious fpqc analogs, and prove that in prime characteristic, they are all regular. We also show that (non-necessarily flat) morphisms \$f\$ of affine Noetherian schemes which are coverings for the fpqc topology descend regularity, at least if \$f\$ is finite, or in positive characteristic.},

  abstract = {From the ancient origins of algebraic geometry in the solution of polynomial equations, through the triumphs of algebraic geometry during the last two cen­ turies, intersection theory has played a central role. Since its role in founda­ tional crises has been no less prominent, the lack of a complete modern treatise on intersection theory has been something of an embarrassment. The aim of this book is to develop the foundations of intersection theory, and to indicate the range of classical and modern applications. Although a comprehensive his­ tory of this vast subject is not attempted, we have tried to point out some of the striking early appearances of the ideas of intersection theory. Recent improvements in our understanding not only yield a stronger and more useful theory than previously available, but also make it possible to devel­ op the subject from the beginning with fewer prerequisites from algebra and algebraic geometry. It is hoped that the basic text can be read by one equipped with a first course in algebraic geometry, with occasional use of the two appen­ dices. Some of the examples, and a few of the later sections, require more spe­ cialized knowledge. The text is designed so that one who understands the con­ structions and grants the main theorems of the first six chapters can read other chapters separately. Frequent parenthetical references to previous sections are included for such readers. The summaries which begin each chapter should fa­ cilitate use as a reference.},

  abstract = {We call the scheme parameterizing homogeneous ideals with fixed initial ideal the Gr\textbackslash{}"obner scheme. We introduce a Bia\{\textbackslash{}l\}ynicki-Birula decomposition of the Hilbert scheme \$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{Hilb\}\^\{P\}\_n\$ for any Hilbert polynomial \$P\$ such that the cells are the Gr\textbackslash{}"obner schemes in set-theoretically. Then we obtain a computable homology formula for smooth Hilbert schemes. As a corollary of our argument, we show that the Gr\textbackslash{}"obner scheme for a monomial ideal defining a smooth point in the Hilbert scheme is smooth.},

  abstract = {This paper is a survey about recent progress on submersive morphisms of schemes combined with new results that we prove. They concern the class of quasicompact universally subtrusive morphisms that we introduced about 30 years ago. They are revisited in a recent paper by Rydh, with substantial complements and key results. We use them to show Artin-Tate-like results about the 14th problem of Hilbert, for a base scheme either Noetherian or the spectrum of a valuation domain. We look at faithfully flat morphisms and get “almost” Artin-Tate-like results by considering the Goldman (finite type) points of a scheme. Bjorn Poonen recently proved that universally closed morphisms are quasicompact. By introducing incomparable morphisms of schemes, we are able to characterize universally closed surjective morphisms that are either integral or finite. Next we consider pure morphisms of schemes introduced by Mesablishvili. In the quasicompact case, they are universally schematically dominant morphisms. This leads us to a characterization of universally subtrusive morphisms by purity. Some results on the schematically dominant property are given. The paper ends with properties of monomorphisms and topological immersions, a dual notion of submersions.},
